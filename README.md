**notfox-starter-projects** is a collection of coding projects initiated in September 2023 as part of a learning journey inspired by the wonderful content created by F0XN0T on GitHub and @notfox on YouTube. You can also find some of these projects on [Koji](https://withkoji.com/@notfoxs).

## Project Overview

This repository was started in 2022 and officially kicked off in September 2023, encompassing both failed and successful coding projects. It's a testament to the learning process, where failures are stepping stones to success, reflecting a 20%-80% ratio with 2 out of 10 projects being successful.

### Failed Projects

1. **FAILED_cheap_password_manager.py**: An attempt at creating a password manager that didn't quite make the cut.

2. **FAILED_your_waifu_bedtime_stories.py**: A project, probably whimsical in nature, that didn't reach its intended goal.

### Successful Projects

Here are some of the successful projects you can explore:

- **gamblejapan_main.py**: A successful project that likely involves some form of a gambling game.

- **janken_rps.py**: A rock-paper-scissors game that turned out to be a hit.

- **number_guesser.py**: A project that lets you guess numbers and was executed successfully.

- **quiz_game.py**: A quiz game project that worked out well.
